/**
 A ZoomedImageView presents an Image in an ImageView that is scrollable
 and zoomable.
 
 It consists of an ImageView managed by a ScrollView and an additional x-shaped
 button which may be used to terminate the ImageView. The button is only visible
 when a closure is defined that is called when the button has been pressed.
 
 The ImageView displays an OptionalImage. If the main image is available, zooming
 and scrolling of that image is enabled. Initially the image is sized and 
 positioned so that it is completely visible but couldn't be enlarged without 
 cropping a part of the image. If the main image is not available, the waiting image 
 is displayed without being zoomable or scrollable and a spinner is shown in
 the centre of the view.
 
 If the main image is displayed a double tap either enlarges the image so that
 its resolution matches the resolution of the screen or (if already enlarged) 
 it is shrinked to its initial size and position.
